# Serial Monitor

This is a serial monitor that allows you to switch baud rates, input to the serial interface, find and switch between open serial ports, and use arduino-cli to compile and upload Arduino code with automatic serial monitoring switch-off during upload.

## How to Use the Serial Monitor

1. List ports
2. Open port
3. Close port
4. Set baud rate
5. Write to port
6. Compile and upload
7. Exit

### Switching Baud Rates

To switch baud rates, use the "Set baud rate" command and enter the desired baud rate.

### Input to the Serial Interface

To input to the serial interface, use the "Write to port" command and enter the data you want to send.

### Finding and Switching Between Open Serial Ports

To find open serial ports, use the "List ports" command. To switch between open serial ports, use the "Open port" command and enter the desired port.

### Using Arduino-CLI to Compile and Upload Arduino Code

To compile and upload Arduino code, use the "Compile and upload" command. Enter the sketch path, board, and port. The serial monitoring will be automatically switched off during the upload process and will resume once the upload is complete.
